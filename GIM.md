# 2/27 General Interest Meeting

***CONTACT [@NATIONALKIM](https://www.instagram.com/nationalkim) ON INSTAGRAM TO JOIN OUR DISCORD***

## Purpose of meeting:
1. Introduce project owner and status
1. Gain an understanding of what this space is like and what kind of work we’re doing (esp. for other orgs or non-NJ individuals who may want to partner on effort down the line)
1. Members meet + discuss (in 2nd session)

## Goals of this project:
1. Physical safety (gear distro, safety information, self-defense resources)
1. Community building through events + virtual gathering space
1. Critical analysis, research, exploration of topics related to the Asian American identity

## Background:
* Violence against Asian Americans has increased by at least 300%, some estimates say around 500%
* Lack of organization + community outside NYC and Bay Area, even though these problems still affect us&mdash;physically, mentally, etc. Possible underreporting. You shouldn’t have to live in a big city to feel like you’re part of a community that has your back.
* Trend of people becoming increasingly aware of issues and wanting to do something, but don’t know how

## Theory/thesis/ethos
* Violence against Asian Americans is multifaceted + therefore requires a multifaceted solution
  * Concrete thesis of safety – build logically off of that
* A fundamental part of the solution is building strong Asian American voices + power, but must be done responsibly. Requires education (not necessarily formal), analysis, communicating and discussing with each other. You cannot do this in a vacuum. Critical to avoid misdirecting energy in harmful ways (for background, there were several Stop Asian Hate efforts in NJ a few years ago that basically ended up allying with right-wing groups)
* There is no walled garden you need to gain entry to in order to do action. You don’t have to be in a city, you don’t have to have a finger on the pulse of society, you are not too uninformed or unaware. Your life experience, whatever it is, is part of our collective identity. No one is too Asian or not Asian enough.
* Help others take action
  * Document everything and help other communities or locations organize themselves, using our project as a reference point
  * Focus on purpose, finding ways to act, and making it easy for others to do so. Telling people exactly how to help.
* Must tweak + iterate on organizational strategy to fit what is largely a suburban NJ environment. Forever a work in progress
* This is not a volunteer organization or nonprofit. This is simply a space to be and offer help when the call goes out.

## Current status of project
I (Natalie) have been running a pilot for ~2 weeks to learn more about what the community needs, what works, what doesn’t work. Now that I’ve gotten a basic sense of things, I’d like to share the lessons with the group and simply facilitate

### Gear Distribution
$900 raised so far, $300 spent

1. Light timer distro at Lunar New Years event in East Brunswick. This was basically just talking to people like a normal person and offering the devices. Most Asian people/families are already aware that we are targeted for home invasions, didn’t need to explain much. Many shared with me that their families didn’t want to put up LNY decorations or reveal Asian identity – “we can’t let them know we’re Chinese.” Figured it would be most effective to identify people who may have a large network, such as business owners or restaurant employees (most receptive), and hand off a stash for them to distribute. Instead of saying “give this to anyone who might need it” (which results in confused and awkward looks), need to explicitly tell them to give it to someone who might
* Live alone
* Travel a lot
* Leave the house empty during work
&emsp; Works much better.

2. Pepper spray spontaneous handouts. This is something I’ve just been personally motivated to do. Started carrying 4-5 pepper sprays when I leave the house to go shopping, to a cafe, etc. I focus on elderly. Lead in by asking "do you shop by yourself a lot" if they’re alone, offer to carry groceries, or similar. Instead of asking "do you want this?" say "you should take this to keep yourself safe, it's free"

### Community building
Stick around for 2nd session if you want to discuss this

### Education/information
Personally aiming for 1 high-quality/high-effort piece per week. Backlog of topic already exists, please reach out if you want an assignment.

We are always open to public submissions, just DM us [@easternmayday](https://www.instagram.com/easternmayday)

Want to boost resources/fundraisers from others. Again, just reach out.

## Part 2
Second session consisted of an hour long discussion amongst 12-13 regional individuals. We introduced ourselves, our networks/spaces/resouces. Discussed ideas for how to best distribute safety gear. Discussed how to best organize people. Planned follow up meeting dedicated to event brainstorming.
