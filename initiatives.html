      Our mission
    </h3>
    <h6>Community defense, consciousness-raising, and solidarity building</h6>
    <p>
      With the rising tide of anti-Asian violence, we organize materially around the thesis of
      <b>physical safety</b>. We are for the democratization of self-defense, where
      women, minorities, and LGBTQ+ have meaningful ownership over their lives. We fundraise for and distribute safety gear, offer
      community self-defense classes through our sister organization
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dragoncombatclub/?hl=en" target="_blank">Dragon Combat Club</a>,
      and advocate for initiatives that decentralize knowledge and empower ordinary people, such as Stop The Bleed courses
      or harm reduction efforts.
      None of our safety efforts are limited to just Asian Americans. In the past, we've assisted with event
      security, provided gear to LGBTQ+ community members, and held vigil at sites targeted by right-wing violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a community in diaspora, our broader mission is to
      Our contributors create and distribute a wide range of educational content,
      with a focus on Asian history and social justice. We
      make short posts on our <a href='https://www.instagram.com/easternmayday' target="_blank">Instagram Page</a>
      as well as create zines, essays, and other resources to educate a broad audience of Asian Americans
      and our allies.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a group, we're interested in building long-term, sustainable solidarity with like-minded
      organizations across borders and boundaries.
