      Our mission
    </h3>
    <h6>Community defense, consciousness-raising, and solidarity building</h6>
    <p>
      With the rising tide of anti-Asian violence, we organize materially around the thesis of
      <b>physical safety</b>. We advocate for the democratization of self-defense, where
      women, minorities, and LGBTQ+ have meaningful ownership over their lives. We distribute safety gear, offer
      community self-defense classes through our sister organization
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dragoncombatclub/?hl=en" target="_blank">Dragon Combat Club</a>,
      and encourage decentralized, civilian medical training, such as Stop The Bleed. In
      the past, we've assisted with protest security, partnered with local harm reduction projects,
      and held vigil at sites targeted by right-wing violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to fundraising for and distributing safety gear, we create and share
      zines, essays, and other resources to educate a broad audience of Asian Americans
      and our allies, with a focus on Asian history and social justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a group, we're interested in building long-term, sustainable solidarity with like-minded
      organizations across borders and boundaries.
