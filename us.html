      Who we are
    </h3>
    <p>
    We are a group of East, Southeast, and South Asian Americans with a shared commitment towards uplifting our lives,
    our struggles, and histories in meaningful ways. We formed in 2022 in response to rising anti-Asian violence, and presently,
    we exist as a collective with members based primarily in New Jersey—with some individuals residing in
    NY, MA, VA, and FL—both within and beyond metropolis boundaries.<br><br>

    Within our group, we maintain a diversity of perspectives, beliefs, backgrounds, and experiences,
    though we organize around a few common principles. We are anti-racist; we believe in
    solidarity over charity; we encourage collaboration, cooperation, and open dialogue; we proudly embrace the Asian
    American identity and encourage unity between Pan-Asian struggles, while discouraging nationalistic and reactionary politics.<br><br>

      A community of mutual solidarity and empowerment from the ground-up
    </h3>

    <p>
    This project is guided by the concrete thesis
    of keeping each other safe. We distribute defensive and safety gear, offer
    self-defense courses through our partner organization
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dragoncombatclub/?hl=en">Dragon Combat Club</a>,
    and maintain a broad network of community defense and mutual aid organizations.
    <br><br>
    However, staying alive is not enough to build a truly safe community. Violence
    comes from many angles; it is multi-faceted, and therefore requries a
    multi-faceted solution—one that encompasses awareness, education, and
    building responsible community power. This is no easy task and will take time.
    <p>
    <h3 id="sectiontitle">
      Our Values
    </h3>
    <p>
    We are not a nonprofit or growth-driven organization. This project is not
    based on volunteerism, charity, member drives, or mandatory meetings. Instead, we
    strategically organize our skills, assets, and time for the good of the community.
    We value free association, consensus-based decision making, and bottom-up participation.
    Any member may propose ideas, lead an initiative, or take ownership of tasks.
    <br><br>
    We believe in the power of local organizing and working within our own immediate
    communities. While large nonprofits and national organizations are effective
    and influential, they often fail to resonate locally, and grassroots initiatives
    help to fill in the gaps. We look to partner with other local projects, community
    collectives, and mutual aid groups in our neighborhoods.
    <br><br>
    Lastly, we believe that all Asian Americans belong here. No one is too Asian, not Asian enough,
    not involved enough, not fluent enough.
